# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe game with a gist of machine learning

In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a
"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed".
He wrote a checkers program that learned by playing against itself and used that data when it played against a human.

With that in mind I thought of applying the same to tic tac toe game(faster implementation).
